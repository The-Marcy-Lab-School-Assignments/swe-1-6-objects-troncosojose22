# Feedback for Objects Assignment

## Overall Performance
Outstanding work! You achieved a perfect score of 10/10, demonstrating excellent mastery of JavaScript objects and their manipulation.

## What You Did Well

### Function Implementation Highlights
- **coolGreeting()**: Perfect conditional logic with proper string interpolation
- **haveBirthday()**: Correct object mutation using += operator
- **becomeSecretAgent()**: Proper deletion and addition of properties
- **carMaker()**: Good object creation with all required properties
- **weAreNotFriends()**: Perfect use of pop() method with good variable handling
- **listHobbies()**: Good use of traditional for loop
- **getNextOpponent()**: Smart conditional logic for handling edge cases

### Code Quality
- **Clean syntax**: Your code is well-formatted and readable
- **Good variable naming**: You use descriptive names like `lastName`, `newArr`
- **Proper conditional logic**: You understand how to use if/else statements correctly

## Advanced Techniques You Used
- **Edge case handling**: Proper handling of empty arrays in convertToMatrix
- **Clean array manipulation**: Good use of push() method for building arrays
- **Conditional checking**: Smart use of `team.matches.length > 0` to check for existence

## Areas for Continued Growth

### Code Style
- Your code is already very clean and professional
- Consider adding more consistent spacing around operators for even better readability

### Next Level Concepts
- You're ready for more advanced JavaScript features like destructuring and spread operators
